<h2>Sir Keir Starmer vows to defend budget decisions 'all day long' as farmers slam 'disrespectful' PM</h2>
<p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href='https://news.sky.com/story/sir-keir-starmer-vows-to-defend-budget-decisions-all-day-long-as-farmers-slam-disrespectful-pm-13255071'>https://news.sky.com/story/sir-keir-starmer-vows-to-defend-budget-decisions-all-day-long-as-farmers-slam-disrespectful-pm-13255071</a></p>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> Sir Keir Starmer has said he will defend the decisions made in the budget "all day long" amid anger from farmers over inheritance tax changes.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced last month in her key speech that from April 2026, farms worth more than £1m will face an inheritance tax rate of 20%, rather than the standard 40% applied to other land and property.

The announcement has sparked anger among farmers who argue this will mean higher food prices, lower food production and having to sell off land to pay for the tax.

Sir Keir defended the budget as he gave his first speech as prime minister at the Welsh Labour conference in Llandudno, North Wales, where farmers have been holding a tractor protest outside.

Sir Keir admitted: "We've ta...</p>

<p><strong>Content:</strong> Essex Police say they are investigating an alleged criminal offence of inciting racial hatred, after Daily Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson said she was "dumbfounded and upset" when officers knocked on her door last Sunday.

Ms Pearson revealed she was told she was being investigated over a year-old deleted post online.

She said she wasn't informed which post had been reported, but suggested it could have been related to the 7 October attacks in Israel or pro-Palestine marches.

She claimed the officers told her she was being investigated for a NCHI (a none crime hate incident) an incident involving an act which is perceived to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards persons with a particular characteristic, but is not illegal.

<p><strong>Content:</strong> Sir Keir Starmer’s first five months have produced little sign of a plan for Labour’s promised National Care Service – and now I’m told there is a “genuine impasse” at the top of government over what to do about social care.

Health Secretary Wes Streeting publicly acknowledges “we can’t solve the NHS crisis” without improving what a government source describes as an “appalling” situation, in a system that’s meant to look after vulnerable and elderly adults in England.

But multiple sources tell me the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost and that the prime minister is yet to make a decision on how to proceed.

Talks have so far failed to decide even whether to hold another review of the system. “Dither, dither, dither,” said one insid...</p>

<h2>No 10 apologises after meat and alcohol served at Diwali event</h2>

<p><strong>Content:</strong> No 10 has apologised after meat and alcohol were served at a Downing Street event to celebrate the festival of Diwali, held last month.

In a letter to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, external, Conservative MP Shivani Raja said the decision was "not in keeping with the customs of many Hindus" and displayed a "disappointing lack of knowledge of the customs and traditions that many British citizens hold dear".

In a statement, first reported by Politico, external, a Downing Street spokesman said "a mistake was made in the organisation of the event".

"We understand the strength of feeling on this issue and so would apologise to the community and assure them it will not happen again," he added....</p>

<p><strong>Content:</strong> He said the man was thought to be a "major supplier" of "highly dangerous" boats and engines to smugglers operating in Belgium and northern France. The NCA said it has been investigating for several years.

Authorities said the man, who has not been named, shipped supplies from Turkey, stored them in Germany, then transported them to northern France.

He was arrested after authorities learned he was travelling from Turkey to the Netherlands.

The man is likely to face legal proceedings in Belgium because the offences he is suspected of committing took place there.

A spokesperson for the public prosecutor's office of West-Flanders said international cooperation is "crucial in the fight against human smuggling".

<h2>Council tax in England set to rise by up to 5%</h2>
<p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy87p9r7j13o'>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy87p9r7j13o</a></p>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> Under current rules, councils in England providing social care services can increase tax rates by up to 5%, while others can increase rates by up to 3%.

Councils who want to increase bills above this level must get permission from the government or hold a referendum.

According to government figures, external, the average band D council tax set by local authorities in England for 2024-25 was £2,171 - an increase of £106 or 5.1% on the previous year.

On Wednesday, the prime minister's press secretary told reporters the 5% threshold set by the previous government "remains the same".

It came after Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch pressed Sir Keir Starmer during Prime Minister's Questions over whether the cap would be kept in place, with th...</p>

<p><strong>Content:</strong> The NHS and the rest of the public sector will be shielded from the rise, but GP practices, run as businesses while delivering NHS services, will be impacted.

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey asked the prime minister if he would exempt GPs and health care providers from the rise.

Sir Keir said the government would ensure GPs "have got the resources we need" and that funding arrangements would be set out "later this year".

Badenoch said the tax rise would see councils having to pay more for social care provision and asked if the government was considering lifting a cap on council tax to fill what she claimed was a £2.4bn hole in local government finances.

The prime minister said the Budget had included £600m to deal with "the pressur...</p>

<p><strong>Content:</strong> It seems reasonable to conclude, at the very least, that both sides were having second thoughts.

It also seems reasonable to say that a second bout of messy and not entirely consistent briefing from each camp underlines the central truth in all of this - the hurt, the rows, the anger, the mistrust which has been there for all to see.

Her apparent lack of enthusiasm was almost immediately evident, when she failed to turn up at the first ever meeting of a new Council of the Nations and Regions in Edinburgh just days into the job.

<p><strong>Content:</strong> But just how Anglophile is he really, some ponder, given his mantra of "America First"?

Sir Keir had the conversation on his mobile in his office next to the cabinet room in No 10.

Team Trump rang the prime minister, after the government had requested a call with them to send their congratulations.

I’m told Trump had spoken to some other leaders first, but seemingly not many.

The plea from some in government, to themselves and an audience beyond Westminster, is to judge Trump by his actions, not by his words.

The verbal fireworks seem inevitable: that is the Trump way but don’t get distracted by them, is the mantra for some.

Not least because brash controversy and wild unpredictability is just the start of it. There is policy to think...</p>

<p><strong>Content:</strong> When the Conservatives were trounced in 1997 it took them four attempts to find a leader who would become Prime Minister.

William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard came and went, before they elected David Cameron.

Westminster now anticipates a fascinating dynamic - a forty something black woman taking on a sixty something white man.

Both Kemi Badenoch and Sir Keir Starmer are, of course, far more than these crude labels but it is a point of obvious demographic contrast it would also be a mistake to overlook.

Politically, the contrast is starker still: the self-described socialist prime minister and a conviction Conservative of plain speaking instinct.

The prime minister had been in Llandudno to speak to Welsh Labour Party members for the country’s party conference.

While the conference room was in a celebratory mood, standing outside were a large group of disgruntled farmers making their feelings clear about Labour’s inheritance tax changes. Speaking to GB News, farmer and TV personality Gareth Wyn Jones said Starmer should have taken the time to speak to them - but he instead opted to “sneak out” the backdoor.

<p><strong>Content:</strong> Jeremy Clarkson, 64, has hit out at Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer following his appearance at the Cop29 Climate Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan this week.

Along with a handful of other world leaders, the PM jetted to Azerbaijan to unveil the UK's plans for an "81 per cent reduction in emissions" by 2035.

During his stint at the summit, Starmer also insisted: "The climate challenge is something that we have got to rise to and that’s why I’ve repeatedly said we’ve got to show leadership." However, as Clarkson highlighted - and mocked - in his latest column, the likes of the USA's President-elect Donald Trump, China's Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Putin, and India's Narendra Modi were a few of big-name leaders not in attendance.

<p><strong>Content:</strong> ‘You got away with this by the skin of your teeth, Howard. We could not take on the motorist and the farmer at the same time.’ Private words from a senior Labour MP to me this week.

He went on to explain: ‘Two fatal tax increase blows will crucify us. We can’t risk inflation rising from doing both in the Budget. I’m getting it in the ear from farmers now and I have made it clear to Rachel, I will not support any more unthought-out policies.’

And there you have it.

<p><strong>Content:</strong> The Home Office has been found to have "cut corners" when it bought an asbestos-ridden prison for £15.4million, according to a major review.

The department is said to have made "a series of poor decisions" that led to the purchase, according to the National Audit Office (NAO).

Although an assessment warned that it was "high risk", the buying process was rushed so the Government could use the site to house asylum seekers. The site near Bexhill in East Sussex had been bought at an inflated price, according to previous reports by The Times.

The former prison was previously intended to house up to 1,200 migrants PA
